## Introduction

### Real World Problem üåé:

Many people spend too much time playing video games and not enough time exercising, especially in cities where there's not much space for physical activity.
The gaming industry is growing fast, with new technologies like VR and AR making games more popular.

### Proposed Solutionüí°:

Making video games that involve physical activity, like using VR to move around, can help. Also, creating special places in cities where people can play these games and exercise at the same time is a good idea. Teaching people about balancing gaming and staying active is important.

### Potential Impact üöÄ:

Creating games that involve physical activity and providing spaces for gaming and exercise can help more people stay healthy while enjoying games. It could reduce problems like obesity and other health issues related to not moving enough. This approach uses technology and gaming to encourage a healthier lifestyle.
